                The three towns are located 140km west from the capital city, Melbourne with a total population of 282
                residents. The area has a rich history with gold being found in 1855 in the Watsons Hill area with many
                people coming from all over the world to mine it. Cape Clear was named by two early miners who were from
                Cape Clear in Ireland. The town continued to grow as the discovery of rich gold opened up mining in
                surrounding areas. At one time Cape Clear had several hotels and shops including a bakery, blacksmiths
                shop, and general store. Illabrook was developed as a town during the gold-rush period, with several
                hotels, numerous stores and a school that opened in 1861. Rokewood Junction also grew into a significant
                settlement in the gold era. In 1868 the town built a bakery, telephone exchange, school and hotel. The
                three towns continued to thrive whilst there was gold but declined as soon as the gold prospecting
                declined. Farming is now the solid backbone of these communities with sheep being the key farming.
